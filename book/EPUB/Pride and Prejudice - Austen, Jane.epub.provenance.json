      "\"Pride and Prejudice\" by Jane Austen is a novel published in 1813. It follows Elizabeth Bennet, who must learn to see past first impressions and hasty judgments. With five daughters and an estate that can only pass to male heirs, the Bennet family faces financial pressure to marry well. When wealthy Mr. Darcy arrives in their countryside neighborhood, his pride and Elizabeth's prejudice set the stage for misunderstandings, hidden truths, and unexpected revelations about character and love. (This is an automatically generated summary.)"
