      "\"The Brothers Karamazov\" by Fyodor Dostoevsky is a novel published between 1879 and 1880. Set in 19th-century Russia, this passionate philosophical work explores profound questions of God, free will, and morality. The story revolves around the volatile Karamazov family: a disreputable father and his three sons—sensual Dmitri, intellectual Ivan, and idealistic Alyosha. As tensions escalate over inheritance and romantic entanglements, the novel delves into faith, doubt, and reason, with patricide at the heart of its dramatic plot. (This is an automatically generated summary.)"
