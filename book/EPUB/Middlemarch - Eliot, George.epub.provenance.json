      "\"Middlemarch\" by George Eliot is a novel published in 1871-1872. Set in a fictional English Midlands town from 1829 to 1832, it weaves together multiple intersecting stories exploring the status of women, marriage, idealism, and political reform. The narrative follows Dorothea Brooke's search for purpose, Dr. Lydgate's medical ambitions, and several other inhabitants navigating love, debt, scandal, and social change against the backdrop of the approaching Reform Act of 1832.
