      "\"Crime and Punishment\" by Fyodor Dostoevsky is a novel published in 1866. It follows Rodion Raskolnikov, an impoverished former law student in Saint Petersburg who plans to murder an unscrupulous pawnbroker. He convinces himself that certain crimes are justifiable if committed by \"extraordinary\" men pursuing higher goals. Once the deed is done, however, he is consumed by confusion, paranoia, and guilt as his theoretical justifications crumble and he faces the internal and external consequences of his actions. (This is an automatically generated summary.)"
