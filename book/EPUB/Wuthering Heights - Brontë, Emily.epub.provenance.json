      "\"Wuthering Heights\" by Emily Brontë is a novel published in 1847. Set on the Yorkshire moors, it follows two landowning families and their turbulent relationships with Heathcliff, a mysterious foster son. Driven by obsessive love, possession, and revenge that spans generations, the story unfolds through dark passion and cruelty. This Gothic tale challenged Victorian morality with its depictions of abuse and class conflict, ultimately becoming a cornerstone of English literature despite its initially polarized reception.
