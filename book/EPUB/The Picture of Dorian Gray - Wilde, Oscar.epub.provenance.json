      "\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" by Oscar Wilde is a philosophical fiction and Gothic horror novel published in 1890. When a beautiful young man wishes that his portrait would age instead of himself, his desire becomes terrifyingly real. As Dorian pursues a life of pleasure and moral corruption, he remains eternally youthful while his painted image transforms into a horrifying record of his sins. Wilde explores beauty, morality, and the dangerous influence of hedonistic philosophy in this tale of vanity and its consequences. (This is an automatically generated summary.)"
