THE FIRST DEPARTURE FROM OTHER DUMAS STORIES MADE BY MONTE CRISTO LIES IN ITS FREEDOM FROM HISTORIC RELATION. DUMAS' LIFELONG PURPOSE WAS TO \"ELEVATE HISTORY TO THE RANK OF FICTION,\" AND HIS LONG LIST OF INTEREST COMPELLING NOVELS AND PLAYS CONSTRUCTED CLOSELY UPON FACT ATTESTS THE REALIZATION OF HIS PURPOSE. BUT IN MONTE CRISTO HE SUDDENLY TURNS ASIDE FROM ESTABLISHED RECORD TO WRITE A NARRATIVE OF UNBRIDLED FANCY. LIBERATED FROM THE TRAMMELS OF HISTORY, HE GIVES FREE REIN TO HIS EXUBERANT IMAGINATION, WRITING CARELESSLY AND SWIFTLY, BUT PRODUCING A STORY THAT WILL ENTHRALI THE ATTENTION AS CERTAINLY AS THE READER HAS AN ANSWERING IMAGINATION.

AN INSIDIOUS ENEMY TO HIS DOMESTIC HAPPINESS IS SET AT WORK WITHIN HIS HOME. THE TWO CATASTROPHES DESCEND SIMULTANEOUSLY, LEAVING THE MAN CRUSHED AND DEMENTED. DANGLARS IS ATTACKED FROM TWO OTHER SIDES BESIDE THE FINANCIAL, SO THAT HIS WIFE'S SOCIAL PRESTIGE AND HIS DAUGHTER'S HAPPINESS ARE OVERTHROWN AT THE SAME TIME WITH HIS FLIGHT. AND IN THE SAME MANNER WITH THE TWO OTHERS, EVERY AVAILABLE INFLUENCE IS BROUGHT TO BEAR UPON THEM. THE FOURFOLD PROBLEM IS ACCURATELY DEMONSTRATED AND COMPREHENSIVELY OUTLINED. IT WOULD ALSO HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY WORKED OUT BUT FOR THE PRESENCE OF AN UNEXPECTED FACTOR-THE FACTOR OF A WOMAN'S RECURRING LOVE. DANTÉS' SWEETHEART, MERCÉDÉS, HAS BEEN WON BY MONDEGO AFTER HER LOVER'S SUDDEN AND INEXPLICABLE DISAPPEARANCE. THE SUBSEQUENT REVENGE, THEREFORE, AGAINST MONDEGO IN ORDER TO BE COMPLETE MUST INCLUDE HIS WIFE AND THEIR SON. THE PITILESS DANTÉS, OR COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO, AS HE IS NOW CALLED, IS ON THE POINT OF SLAYING THE SON AFTER HAVING PRACTICALLY ACCOMPLISHED THE FATHER'S DISGRACE, WHEN THE WIFE, MERCÉDÉS, PIERCES THE COUNT'S DISGUISE, TILL THEN IMPENETRABLE, AND IMPLORES HIM TO PITY IN THE NAME OF THEIR OWN FORMER LOVE.

SYSTEM OF REVENGE IS DISTURBED AND THWARTED BECAUSE HE HAS NOT SUCCEEDED IN CRUSHING OUT HIS HEART. THE INCIDENT COMES AS A BLESSED RELIEF AFTER MANY PAGES FREIGHTED WITH FATALITY.

MONTE CRISTO CANNOT APPEAL AS AN ACTUAL, LIVING PERSON. HE IS RATHER ONE OF THE FORCES OF NATURE, HARDLY HUMAN IN CONCEPTION, AND ROBED WITH AN AIR OF MYSTERY THAT PREVENTS A PERSONAL ACQUAINTANCE. ONE CANNOT BE ATTRACTED BY HIS INDIVIDUALITY, BUT IS REPELLED INSTEAD BY THE QUALITIES WHICH HE ASSIDUOUSLY CULTIVATES.

HE RESOLVED TO ADOPT THE SECOND, AND BEGAN THAT DAY TO CARRY OUT HIS RESOLVE. NEARLY FOUR YEARS HAD PASSED AWAY; AT THE END OF THE SECOND HE HAD CEASED TO MARK THE LAPSE OF TIME.

NOTHING BUT THE RECOLLECTION OF HIS OATH GAVE HIM STRENGTH TO PROCEED. HUNGER MADE VIANDS ONCE REPUGNANT, NOW ACCEPTABLE; HE HELD THE PLATE IN HIS HAND FOR AN HOUR AT A TIME, AND, GAZED THOUGHTFULLY AT THE MORSEL OF BAD MEAT, OF TAINTED FISH, OF BLACK AND MOULDY BREAD.

THEY HAD AGREED TO SEE THE CARNIVAL AT ROME THAT YEAR, AND THAT FRANZ, WHO FOR THE LAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS HAD INHABITED ITALY, SHOULD ACT AS CICERONE TO ALBERT. AS IT IS NO INCONSIDERABLE AFFAIR TO SPEND THE CARNIVAL AT ROME, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE NO GREAT DESIRE TO SLEEP ON THE PIAZZA DEL POPOLO, OR THE CAMPO VACCINO, THEY WROTE TO SIGNOR PASTRINI, THE PROPRIETOR OF THE HOTEL DE LONDRES, PIAZZA DI SPAGNA, TO RESERVE COMFORTABLE APARTMENTS FOR THEM. SIGNOR PASTRINI REPLIED THAT HE HAD ONLY TWO ROOMS AND A PARLOR ON THE THIRD FLOOR, WHICH HE OFFERED AT THE LOW CHARGE OF A LOUIS PER DIEM. THEY ACCEPTED HIS OFFER ; BUT WISHING TO MAKE THE BEST USE OF THE TIME THAT WAS LEFT, ALBERT STARTED FOR NAPLES. AS FOR FRANZ, HE REMAINED AT FLORENCE, AND AFTER HAVING PASSED A FEW DAYS IN EXPLORING THE PARADISE OF THE CASCINE, AND SPENDING TWO OR THREE EVENINGS AT THE HOASES OF THE FLORENTINE NOBILITY, HE TOOK A FANCY INTO HIS HEAD (HAVING ALREADY VISITED CORSICA, THE CRADLE OF BONAPARTE) TO VISIT ELBA, THE HALTING-PLACE OF NAPOLEON. ONE EVENING HE CAST OFF THE PAINTER OF A SAILBOAT FROM THE IRON RING THAT SECURED IT TO THE DOCK AT LEGHORN, WRAPPED HIMSELF IN HIS COAT AND LAY DOWN, AND SAID TO THE CREW, - \"TO THE ISLAND OF ELBA!\" THE BOAT SHOT OUT OF THE HARBOR LIKE A BIRD, AND THE NEXT MORNING FRANZ DISEMBARKED AT PORTO-FERRAJO.",

'THE VISION HAD FLED; AND AS IF THE STATUES HAD BEEN BUT SHADOWS FROM THE TOMB, THEY HAD VANISHED AT HIS WAKING. HE ADVANCED SEVERAL PACES TOWARDS THE POINT WHENCE THE LIGHT CAME, AND TO ALL THE EXCITEMENT OF HIS DREAM SUCCEEDED THE CALMNESS OF REALITY. HE FOUND THAT HE WAS INA GROTTO, WENT TOWARDS THE OPENING, AND THROUGH A KIND OF FANLIGHT SAW A BLUE SEA AND ANAZURESKY. THE AIR AND WATER WERE SHINING IN THE BEAMS OF THE MORNING SUN; ON THE SHORE THE SAILORS WERE SITTING, CHATTING AND LAUGHING; AND AT TEN YARDS FROM THEM THE BOAT WAS AT ANCHOR, UNDULATING GRACEFULLY ON THE WATER. THERE FOR SOME TIME HE ENJOYED THE FRESH BREEZE WHICH PLAYED ON HIS BROW, AND LISTENED TOTHE DASH OF THE WAVES ON THE BEACH, THAT LEFT AGAINST THE ROCKS A LACE OF FOAM AS WHITE AS SILVER. HE WAS FOR SOME TIME WITHOUT REFLECTION OR THOUGHT FOR THE DIVINE CHARM WHICH IS IN THE THINGS OF NATURE, SPECIALLY AFTER A FANTASTIC DREAM; THEN GRADUALLY THIS VIEW OF THE OUTER WORLD, SO CALM, SO PURE, SO GRAND, REMINDED HIM OF THE ILLUSIVENESS OF HIS VISION, AND ONCE MORE AWAKENED MEMORY. HE RECALLED HIS ARRIVAL ON THE ISLAND, HIS PRESENTATION TO A SMUGGLER CHIEF, A SUBTERRANEAN PALACE FULL OF SPLENDOR, AN EXCELLENT SUPPER, AND A SPOONFUL OF HASHISH.

AS TO FRANZ, HE HAD NO LONGER ANY INDUCEMENT TO REMAIN AT MONTE CRISTO. HE HAD LOST ALL HOPE OF DETECTING THE SECRET OF THE GROTTO; HE CONSEQUENTLY DESPATCHED HIS BREAKFAST, AND, HIS BOAT BEING READY, HE HASTENED ON BOARD, AND THEY WERE SOON UNDER WAY.

THE BOAT SAILED ON ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT, AND NEXT MORNING, WHEN THE SUN ROSE, THEY HAD LOST SIGHT OF MONTE CRISTO. WHEN FRANZ HAD ONCE AGAIN SET FOOT ON SHORE, HE FORGOT, FOR THE MOMENT AT LEAST, THE EVENTS WHICH HAD JUST PASSED, WHILE HE FINISHED HIS AFFAIRS OF PLEASURE AT FLORENCE, AND THEN THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT HOW HE SHOULD REJOIN HIS COMPANION, WHO WAS AWAITING HIM AT ROME. HE SET OUT, AND ON THE SATURDAY EVENING REACHED THE ETERNAL CITY BY THE MAIL-COACH. AN APARTMENT, AS WE HAVE SAID, HAD BEEN RETAINED BEFOREHAND, AND THUS HE HAD BUT TO GO TO SIGNOR PASTRINI'S HOTEL. BUT THIS WAS NOT SO EASY A MATTER, FOR THE STREETS WERE THRONGED WITH PEOPLE, GND ROME WAS ALREADY A PREY TO THAT LOW AND FEVERISH MURMUR WHICH PRECEDES ALL GREAT EVENTS ; AND AT ROME THERE ARE FOUR GREAT EVENTS IN EVERY YEAR, - THE CARNIVAL, HOLY WEEK, CORPUS CHRISTI, AND THE FEAST OF ST. PETER. ALL THE REST OF THE YEAR THE CITY IS IN THAT STATE OF DULL APATHY, BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH, WHICH RENDERS IT SIMILAR TO A KIND OF STATION BETWEEN THIS WORLD AND THE NEXT -A SUBLIME SPOT, A RESTING-PLACE FULL OF POETRY AND CHARACTER, AND AT WHICH FRANZ HAD ALREADY HALTED FIVE OR SIX TIMES, AND AT EACH TIME FOUND IT MORE MARVELLOUS AND STRIKING. AT LAST HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE MOB, WHICH WAS CONTINUALLY INCREASING AND GETTING MORE AND MORE TURBULENT, AND REACHED THE HOTEL.. ON HIS FIRST INQUIRY HE WAS TOLD, WITH THE IMPERTINENCE PECULIAR TO HIRED PENE COACHMEN AND INNKEEPERS WITH THEIR HOUSES FULL, THAT THERE WAS NO ROOM FOR HIM AT THE HÉTEL DE LONDRES. THEN HE SENT HIS CARD TO SIGNOR PASTRINI, AND ASKED FOR ALBERT DE MORCERF. THIS PLAN SUCCEEDED; AND SIGNOR PASTRINI HIMSELF RAN TO HIM, EXCUSING HIMSELF FOR HAVING MADE HIS EXCEL' LENCY WAIT, SEOLDING THE WAITERS, TAKING THE CANDLESTICK FROM THE PORTER, WHO WAS READY TO POUNCE ON THE TRAVELLER, AND WAS ABOUT TO LEAD HIM TO ALBERT, WHEN MORCERF HIMSELF APPEARED.

HE RESOLVED, THEREFORE, TO LET THINGS TAKE THEIR COURSE WITHOUT MAKING ANY DIRECT OVERTURE TO THE COUNT.

AND AS AT THIS MOMENT THE ORCHESTRA GAVE THE SIGNAL FOR THE WALTZ, ALBERT PUT HIS ARM ROUND THE WAIST OF THE COUNTESS, AND DISAPPEARED WITH HER IN THE WHIRL OF DANCERS. IN THE MEANWHILE FRANZ WAS CONSIDERING THE SINGULAR SHUDDER THAT HAD PASSED OVER THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO AT THE MOMENT WHEN HE HAD BEEN, IN SOME SORT, FORCED TO GIVE HIS HAND TO ALBERT. CHAPTER XXXVIII. THE COMPACT. TUE FIRST WORDS THAT ALBERT UTTERED TO HIS FRIEND, ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING, CONTAINED A REQUEST THAT FRANZ WOULD ACCOMPANY HIM ON A VISIT TO THE COUNT; TRUE, THE YOUNG MAN HAD WARMLY AND ENERGETICALLY THANKED THE COUNT ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING; BUT SERVICES SUCH AS HE HAD RENDERED COULD NEVER BE TOO OFTEN ACKNOWLEDGED. FRANZ, WHO SEEMED ATTRACTED BY SOME INVISIBLE INFLUENCE TOWARDS THE COUNT, IN WHICH TERROR WAS STRANGELY MINGLED, FELT AN EXTREME RELUCTANCE TO PERMIT HIS FRIEND TO BE EXPOSED ALONE TO THE SINGULAR FASCINATION THAT THIS MYSTERIOUS PERSONAGE SEEMED TO EXERCISE OVER HIM, AND THEREFORE MADE NO OBJECTION TO ALBERT'S REQUEST, BUT AT ONCE ACCOMPANIED HIM TO THE DESIRED SPOT, AND, AFTER A SHORT DELAY, THE COUNT JOINED THEM IN THE SALON. \"MY DEAR COUNT,\" SAID ALBERT, ADVANCING TO MEET HIM, \"PERMIT ME TO REPEAT THE POOR THANKS I OFFERED LAST NIGHT, AND TO ASSURE YOU THAT THE REMEMBRANCE OF ALL I OWE TO YOU WILL NEVER BE EFFACED FROM MY MEMORY; BELIEVE ME, AS LONG AS I LIVE, I SHALL NEVER CEASE TO DWELL WITH GRATEFUL RECOLLECTION ON THE PROMPT AND IMPORTANT SERVICE YOU RENDERED ME; AND ALSO TO REMEMBER THAT TO YOU I AM INDEBTED EVEN FOR MY JIFE.'\"- \"MY VERY GOOD FRIEND AND EXCELLENT NEIGHBOR,\" REPLIED THE COUNT, WITH A SMILE, \"YOU REALLY EXAGGERATE MY TRIFLING EXERTIONS.

THE GUESTS. IN THE HOUSE IN THE RUE DU HELDER, WHERE ALBERT HAD INVITED THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO, EVERYTHING WAS BEING PREPARED ON THE MORNING OF THE 21ST OF MAY TO DO HONOR TO THE OCCASION. ALBERT DE MORCERF INHABITED A PAVILION SITUATED AT THE CORNER OF A LARGE COURT, AND DIRECTLY OPPOSITE ANOTHER BUILDING, IN WHICH WERE THE SERVANTS' APARTMENTS. TWO WINDOWS ONLY OF THE PAVILION FACED THE STREET ; THREE OTHER WINDOWS LOOKED INTO THE COURT, AND TWO AT THE BACK INTO THE GARDEN. BETWEEN THE COURT AND THE GARDEN, BUILT IN THE HEAVY STYLE OF THE IMPERIAL ARCHITECTURE, WAS THE LARGE AND FASHIONABLE DWELLING OF THE COUNT AND COUNTESS OF MORCERF. A HIGH WALL SURROUNDED THE WHOLE OF THE HOTEL, SURMOUNTED AT INTERVALS BY VASES FILLED WITH FLOWERS, AND BROKEN IN THE CENTRE BY A LARGE GATE OF GILDED IRON, WHICH SERVED AS THE CARRIAGE ENTRANCE. A SMALL DOOR, CLOSE TO THE LODGE OF THE CONCIERGE, GAVE INGRESS AND EGRESS TO THE SERVANTS AND MASTERS WHEN THEY WERE ON FOOT. IT WAS EASY TO DISCOVER THAT THE DELICATE CARE OF A MOTHER,",

IR THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO HAD BEEN FOR A LONG TIME FAMILIAR WITH THE WAYS OF PARISIAN SOCIETY, HE WOULD HAVE APPRECIATED BETTER THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STEP WHICH M. DE VILLEFORT HAD TAKEN. STANDING WELL AT COURT, WHETHER THE KING REGNANT WAS OF THE ELDER OR YOUNGER BRANCH, WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT WAS DOCTRINAIRE, LIBERAL, OR CONSERVATIVE ; LOOKED UPON BY ALL AS A MAN OF TALENT, SINCE THOSE WHO HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED A POLITICAL CHECK ARE GENERALLY SO REGARDED; HATED BY MANY, BUT WARMLY SUPPORTED BY OTHERS, WITHOUT BEING REALLY LIKED BY ANYBODY, M. DE VILLEFORT HELD A HIGH POSITION IN THE MAGISTRACY, AND MAINTAINED HIS EMINENCE LIKE A HARLAY OR A MOLÉ. HIS DRAWING-ROOM, UNDER THE REGENERATING INFLUENCE OF A YOUNG WIFE AND A DAUGHTER BY HIS FIRST MARRIAGE, SCARCELY EIGHTEEN, WAS STILL ONE OF THE WELL-REGULATED PARIS SALONS WHERE THE WORSHIP OF TRADITIONAL CUSTOMS AND THE OBSERVANCE OF RIGID ETIQUETTE WERE CAREFULLY MAINTAINED. A FREEZING POLITENESS, A STRICT FIDELITY TO GOVERNMENT PRINCIPLES, A PROFOUND CONTEMPT FOR THEORIES AND THEORISTS, A DEEP-SEATED HATRED OF IDEALITY, -THESE WERE THE ELEMENTS OF PRIVATE AND PUBLIC LIFE DISPLAYED BY M. DE VILLEFORT. HE WAS NOT ONLY A MAGISTRATE, HE WAS ALMOST A DIPLOMATIST. HIS RELATIONS WITH THE FORMER COURT, OF WHICH HE ALWAYS SPOKE WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT, MADE HIM RESPECTED BY THE NEW ONE, AND HE KNEW SO MANY THINGS, THAT NOT ONLY WAS HE ALWAYS CAREFULLY CONSIDERED, BUT SOMETIMES CONSULTED. PERHAPS THIS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO HAD IT BEEN POSSIBLO TO GET RID OF M. DE VILLEFORT; BUT, LIKE THE FEUDAL BARONS WHO REBELLED AGAINST THEIR SOVEREIGN, HE DWELT IN AN IMPREGNABLE FORTRESS.

ORDINARILY M. DE VILLEFORT MADE AND RETURNED VERY FEW VISITS. HIS WIFE VISITED FOR HIM, AND THIS WAS THE RECEIVED THING IN THE WORLD, WHERE THE WEIGHTY AND MULTIFARIOUS OCCUPATIONS OF THE MAGISTRATE WERE ACCEPTED AS AN EXCUSE FOR WHAT WAS REALLY ONLY CALCULATED PRIDE, A MANIFESTATION OF PROFESSCD SUPERIORITY-IN FACT, THE APPLICATION OF THE AXIOM, \" PRETEND TO THINK WELL OF YOURSELF, AND THE WORLD WILL THINK WELL OF YOU,\" AN AXIOM A HUNDRED TIMES MORE USEFUL IN SOCIETY",

HE CAME TO RENEW THE THANKS OF MADAME DANGLARS WHICH HAD BEEN ALREADY CONVEYED TO THE COUNT THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF A LETTER, SIGNED \"BARONNE DANGLARS, NÉE HERMINE DE SERVIEUX.\" ALBERT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY LUCIEN DEBRAY, WHO, JOINING IN HIS FRIEND'S CONVERSATION, ADDED SOME PASSING COMPLIMENTS, THE SOURCE OF WHICH THE COUNT'S TALENT FOR FINESSE EASILY ENABLED HIM TO GUESS. HE WAS CONVINCED THAT LUCIEN'S VISIT WAS DUE TO A DOUBLE FEELING OF CURIOSITY, THE LARGER HALF OF WHICH SENTIMENT EMANATED FROM THE RUE DE LA CHAUSSÉE D'ANTIN. IN SHORT, MADAME DANGLARS, NOT BEING ABLE PERSONALLY TO EXAMINE IN DETAIL THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY AND HOUSEHOLD ARRANGEMENTS OF A MAN WHO GAVE AWAY HORSES WORTH 30,000 FRANCS AND WHO WENT TO THE OPERA WITH A GREEK SLAVE WEARING DIAMONDS TO THE AMOUNT OF A MILLION OF MONEY, HAD DEPUTED THOSE EYES, BY WHICH SHE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO SEE, TO GIVE HER A FAITHFUL ACCOUNT OF THE MODE OF LIFE OF THIS INCOMPREHENSIBLE PERSON.

THEREFORE, SCARCELY HAD THE STRANGER TIME TO PRONOUNCE HIS NAME BEFORE THE COUNT WAS APPRISED OF HIS ARRIVAL.

THEN HE HAD BEEN SEIZED UPON BY DANGLARS, WHO, WITH A RAPID GLANCE AT THE STIFFNECKED OLD MAJOR AND HIS MODEST SON, AND TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE HOSPITALITY OF THE COUNT, MADE UP HIS MIND THAT HE WAS IN THE SOCIETY OF SOME NABOB COME TO PARIS TO FINISH THE WORLDLY EDUCATION OF HIS HEIR. HE CONTEMPLATED WITH UNSPEAKABLE DELIGHT THE LARGE DIAMOND WHICH SHONE ON THE MAJOR'S LITTLE FINGER; FOR THE MAJOR, LIKE A PRUDENT MAN, IN CASE OF ANY ACCIDENT HAPPENING TO HIS BANK-NOTES, HAD IMMEDIATELY CONVERTED THEM INTO AN AVAILABLE ASSET. THEN, AFTER DINNER, ON THE PRETEXT OF BUSINESS, HE QUESTIONED THE FATHER AND SON UPON THEIR MODE OF LIVING; AND THE FATHER AND SON, PREVIOUSLY INFORMED THAT IT WAS THROUGH DANGLARS THE ONE WAS TO RECEIVE HIS 48,000 FRANCS AND THE OTHER 50,000 LIVRES ANNUALLY, WERE SO FULL OF AFFABILITY THAT THEY WOULD HAVE SHAKEN HANDS EVEN WITH THE BANKER'S SERVANTS, SO MUCH DID THEIR GRATITUDE NEED AN OBJECT TO EXPEND ITSELF UPON",

ONE DIVISION OF LA FORCE, IN WHICH THE MOST DANGEROUS AND DESPERATE PRISONERS ARE CONFINED, IS CALLED THE COURT OF SAINTBERNARD. THE PRISONERS, IN THEIR EXPRESSIVE LANGUAGE, HAVE NAMED IT THE \"LIONS' DEN,\" PROBABLY BECAUSE THE CAPTIVES POSSESS TEETH WHICH FREQUENTLY GNAW THE BARS, AND SOMETIMES THE KEEPERS ALSO. IT IS A PRISON WITHIN A PRISON; THE WALLS ARE DOUBLE THE THICKNESS OF THE REST. THE GRATINGS ARE EVERY DAY CAREFULLY EXAMINED BY JAILERS, WHOSE HERCULEAN PROPORTIONS AND COLD PITILESS EXPRESSION PROVE THEM TO HAVE BEEN CHOSEN TO REIGN OVER THEIR SUBJECTS FOR THEIR SUPERIOR ACTIVITY AND INTELLIGENCE. THE COURT-YARD OF THIS QUARTER IS EUCLOSED BY ENORMOUS WALLS, OVER WHICH THE SUN GLANCES OBLIQUELY, WHEN IT DEIGNS TO PENETRATE INTO THIS GULF OF MORAL AND PHYSICAL DEFORMITY. ON THIS PAVED YARD ARE TO BE SEEN,- PACING TO AND FRO FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT, PALE, CAREWORN, AND HAGGARD, LIKE SO MANY SHADOWS, - THE MEN WHOM JUSTICE HOLDS BENEATH THE STEEL SHE IS SHARPENING. THERE, CROUCHED AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE WALL WHICH ATTRACTS AND RETAINS THE MOST HEAT, THEY MAY BE SEEN SOMETIMES TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER, BUT MORE FREQUENTLY ALONE, WATCHING THE DOOR, WHICH SOMETIMES OPENS TO CALL FORTH ONE FROM THE GLOOMY ASSEMBLAGE, OR TO THROW IN ANOTHER OUTCAST FROM SOCIETY. \"THE COURT OF SAINT-BERNARD HAS ITS OWN PARTICULAR APARTMENT FOR THE RECEPTION OF GUESTS; IT 1S A LONG RECTANGLE, DIVIDED BY TWO UPRIGHT GRATINGS PLACED AT A DISTANCE OF THREE FEET FROM ONE ANOTHER TO PREVENT A VISITOR FROM SHAKING HANDS WITH OR PASSING ANYTHING TO THE PRISONERS. IT IS A WRETCHED, DAMP, NAY, EVEN HORRIBLE SPOT, MORE ESPECIALLY WHEN WE CONSIDER THE AGONIZING CONFERENCES WHICH HAVE TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN THOSE IRON BARS. AND YET, FRIGHTFUL THOUGH THIS SPOT MAY BE, IT IS LOOKED UPON AS A KIND OF PARADISE BY THE MEN WHOSE DAYS ARE NUMBERED; IT IS SO RARE FOR THEM TO LEAVE THE LIONS' DEN FOR ANY OTHER PLACE THAN THE BARRIER SAINT-JACQUES OR THE GALLEYS! IN THE COURT WHICH WE HAVE ATTEMPTED TO DESCRIBE, AND FROM WHICH A DAMP VAPOR WAS RISING, A YOUNG MAN WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS, WHO HAD EXCITED MUCH CURIOSITY AMONG THE INHABITANTS OF THE \"DEN,\" MIGHT BE SEEN WALKING.

ANDREA EXTENDED HIS HAND; BERTUCCIO KEPT HIS OWN IN HIS POCKET, AND MERELY JINGLED A FEW PIECES OF MONEY. \"THAT'S WHAT I MEAN,\" SAID ANDREA, ENDEAVORING TO SMILE, UITE OVERCOME BY THE STRANGE TRANQUILLITY OF BERTUCCIO. \"CAN AS DECEIVED ?\" HE MURMURED, AS HE STEPPED INTO THE OBLONG AND GRATED VEHICLE WHICH THEY CALL \"THE SALAD BASKET.\" ' NEVER MIND, WE SHALL SEE!

WE REMEMBER THAT THE ABBÉ BUSONI REMAINED ALONE WITH NOIRTIER IN THE CHAMBER OF DEATH, AND THAT THE OLD MAN AND THE PRIEST WERE THE SOLE GUARDIANS OF THE YOUNG GIRL'S BODY. | PERHAPS IT WAS THE CHRISTIAN EXHORTATIONS OF THE ABBÉ, PERHAPS HIS KIND CHARITY, PERHAPS HIS PERSUASIVE WORDS, WHICH HAD RESTORED THE COURAGE OF NOIRTIER, FOR EVER SINCE HE HAD CONVERSED WITH THE PRIEST HIS VIOLENT DESPAIR HAD YIELDED TO A CALM RESIGNATION WHICH SURPRISED ALL WHO KNEW HIS EXCESSIVE AFFECTION FOR VALENTINE. M. DE VILLEFORT HAD NOT SEEN HIS FATHER SINCE THE MORNING OF THE DEATH. THE WHOLE ESTABLISHMENT HAD BEEN CHANGED ; ANOTHER VALET WAS ENGAGED FOR HIMSELF, A NEW SERVANT FOR NOIRTIER, TWO WOMEN HAD ENTERED MADAME DE VILLEFORT'S SERVICE, - IN FACT, EVERYWHERE, TO THE CONCIERGE AND COACHMEN, NEW FACES WERE PRESENTED TO THE DIFFERENT MASTERS OF THE HOUSE, THUS WIDENING THE DIVISION WHICH HAD ALWAYS EXISTED BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF THE SAME FAMILY. THE ASSIZES, ALSO, WERE ABOUT TO BEGIN, AND VILLEFORT, SHUT UP IN HIS ROOM, EXERTED HIMSELF WITH FEVERISH ANXIETY IN DRAWING UP THE CASE AGAI.ST THE MURDERER OF CADEROUSSE. THIS AFFAIR, LIKE ALL THOSE IN WHICH THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO HAD INTERFERED, CAUSED A GREAT SENSATION IN PARIS. THE PROOFS WERE CERTAINLY NOT CONVINCING, SINCE THEY RESTED UPON A FEW WORDS WRITTEN BY AN ESCAPED GALLEY-SLAVE ON HIS DEATH-BED, AND WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN ACTUATED BY HATRED OR REVENGE IN ACCUSING HIS COMPANION. BUT THE MIND OF THE PROCUREUR WAS MADE UP;",

IF I TIND YOU ALIVE ON MY RETURN, YOU SHALL SLEEP TO-NIGHT IN THE CONCIERGERIE.\" MADAME DE VILLEFORT SIGHED; HER NERVES GAVE WAY, AND SHE SUNK ON THE CARPET. THE KING'S ATTORNEY SEEMED TO EXPERIENCE A SENSATION OF PITY; HE LOOKED UPON HER LESS SEVERELY, AND, BOWING TO HER, SAID SLOWLY, \" FAREWELL, MADAME, FAREWELL!\" THAT FAREWELL STRUCK MADAME DE VILLEFORT LIKE THE EXECUTIONER'S KNIFE. SHE FAINTED. THE PROCUREUR WENT OUT, AFTER HAVING DOUBLE-LOCKED THE DOOR. CHAPTER CIX. THE ASSIZES. TUE BENEDETTO AFFAIR, AS IT WAS CALLED AT THE PALAIS, AND BY PEOPLE IN GENERAL, HAD PRODUCED A TREMENDOUS SENSATION. FREQUENTING THE CAFÉ DE PARIS, THE BOULEVARD DE GAND, AND THE BOIS DE BOULOGNE, DURING HIS BRIEF CAREER OF SPLENDOR, THE FALSE CAVALCANTI HAD FORMED A HOST OF ACQUAINTANCES. THE PAPERS HAD RELATED HIS VARIOUS ADVENTURES, BOTH AS THE MAN OF FASHION AND THE GALLEY-SLAVE ; AND AS EVERY ONE WHO HAD BEEN PERSONALLY ACQUAINTED WITH PRINCE ANDREA CAVALCANTI EXPERIENCED A LIVELY CURIOSITY IN HIS FATE, THEY ALL DETERMINED TO SPARE NO TROUBLE IN ENDEAVORING TO WITNESS THE TRIAL OF M. BENEDETTO FOR THE MURDER OF HIS COMRADE IN CHAINS. IN THE EYES OF MANY, BENEDETTO APPEARED, IF NOT A VICTIM TO, AT LEAST AN INSTANCE OF, THE FALLIBILITY OF THE LAW. M. CAVALCANTI, HIS FATHER, HAD BEEN SEEN IN PARIS, AND IT WAS EXPECTED THAT HE WOULD RE-APPEAR TO CLAIM THE ILLUSTRIOUS OUTCAST. MANY, ALSO, WHO WERE NOT AWARE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HIS WITHDRAWAL FROM PARIS, WERE STRUCK WITH THE WORTHY APPEARANCE, THE GENTLEMANLY BEARING, AND THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD DISPLAYED BY THE OLD PATRICIAN, WHO CERTAINLY PLAYED THE NOBLEMAN VERY WELL, SO LONG AS HE SAID NOTHING, AND MADE NO ARITHMETICAL CALCULATIONS. AS FOR THE ACCUSED HIMSELF, MANY REMEMBERED HIM AS BEING SO AMIABLE, SO HANDSOME, AND SO LIBERAL, THAT THEY CHOSE TO THINK HIM THE VICTIM OF SOME CONSPI ",

CHAPTER CXI. EXPIATION. NOTWITTHSTANDING THE DENSITY OF THE CROWD, M. DE VILLEFORT SAW IT OPEN BEFORE HIM. THERE IS SOMETHING SO AWE-INSPIRING IN GREAT AFFLICTIONS THAT EVEN IN THE WORST TIMES THE FIRST EMOTION OF A CROWD HAS GENERALLY BEEN TO SYMPATHIZE WITH THE SUFFERER IN A GREAT CATASTROPHE. MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ASSASSINATED IN A TUMULT, BUT EVEN CRIMINALS HAVE RARELY BEEN INSULTED DURING TRIAL. THUS VILLEFORT PASSED THROUGH THE MASS OF SPECTATORS AND OFFICERS OF THE PALAIS, AND WITHDREW. THOUGH HE HAD ACKNOWLEDGED HIS GUILT, HE WAS PROTECTED BY HIS GRIEF.

'OH,' HE SAID, \"HE IS MAD!\" AND AS THOUGH HE FEARED THAT THE WALLS OF THE ACCURSED HOUSE WOULD CRUMBLE AROUND HIM, HE RUSHED INTO THE STREET, FOR THE FIRST TIME DOUBTING WHETHER HE HAD THE RIGHT TO DO AS HE HAD DONE. \"OH, ENOUGH OF THIS, - ENOUGH OF THIS,\" HE CRIED; \"LET ME SAVE THE LAST.\" ON ENTERING HIS HOUSE, HE MET MORREL, WHO WANDERED ABOUT LIKE A GHOST AWAITING THE HEAVENLY MANDATE FOR RETURN TO THE TOMB. \" PREPARE YOURSELF, MAXIMILIAN,\" HE SAID WITH A SMILE; \"WE LEAVE PARIS TO-MORROW.\" -\" HAVE YOU NOTHING MORE TO DO THERE?\" ASKED MORREL. \"NO,\" REPLIED MONTE CRISTO; \"GOD GRANT I MAY NOT HAVE DONE TOO MUCH ALREADY.\" THE NEXT DAY THEY INDEED LEFT, ACCOMPANIED ONLY BY BAPTISTIN.

AS FOR PEPPINO, HE EXAMINED THE PAPER ATTENTIVELY, PUT IT INTO HIS POCKET, AND CONTINUED EATING HIS PEASE. CHAPTER CXVI. THE PARDON. TUE NEXT DAY DANGLARS WAS AGAIN HUNGRY; CERTAINLY THE AIR OF THAT DUNGEON WAS VERY PROVOCATIVE OF APPETITE. THE PRISONER EXPECTED THAT HE WOULD BE AT NO EXPENSE THAT DAY, FOR LIKE AN ECONOMICAL MAN HE HAD CONCEALED HALF OF HIS FOWL AND A PIECE OF THE BREAD IN THE CORNER OF HIS CELL.

HE REMAINED THERE ALL NIGHT, NOT KNOWING WHERE HE WAS. WHEN DAYLIGHT DAWNED HE SAW THAT HE WAS NEAR A STREAM; HE WAS THIRSTY, AND DRAGGED HIMSELF TOWARDS IT. AS HE STOOPED DOWN TO DRINK, HE SAW THAT HIS HAIR HAD BECOME ENTIRELY WHITE. CHAPTER CXVILI. THE FIFTH OF OCTOBER. IR WAS ABOUT SIX O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING; AN OPAL-COLORED LIGHT, THROUGH WHICH AN AUTUMNAL SUN SHED ITS GOLDEN RAYS, DESCENDED ON THE BLUE OCEAN. THE HEAT OF THE DAY HAD GRADUALLY DECREASED, AND A LIGHT BREEZE AROSE, SEEMING LIKE THE RESPIRATION OF NATURE ON AWAKENING FROM THE BURNING SIESTA OF THE SOUTH. A DELICIOUS ZEPHYR PLAYED ALONG THE COASTS OF THE MEDITERRANEAN, AND WAFTED FROM SHORE TO SHORE THE SWEET PERFUME OF PLANTS, MINGLED WITH THE FRESH SMELL OF THE SEA.
