YO SEM, we did enough talks on collapse, drugs , dopamine etc. I am working now and I think the SOBER Sumit is coming back at work, can you give me real detailed tips to make him work like he has done drugs (little euphoric,  little-bit extra focused, forget useless points etc.) I know I asked you this before, but this time whatever you are going to tell will be followed-as-it-is. so try to give me real-life tips to bring good qualities of high Sumit (good qualities only that can help me in working or coding) in SOBER SUMIT.
