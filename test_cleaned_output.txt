Chapter 1: The Beginning

It was a dark and stormy night when Sarah first realized her life would never be the same again. The wind howled through the trees as she clutched her coat tightly around her.

"Where are you going?" asked her friend Mark, his voice barely audible over the storm.

"I don't know," Sarah replied. "But I can't stay here anymore."

The rain poured down as they made their way through the forest. Each step brought them closer to the unknown.
