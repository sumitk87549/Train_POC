He then joined the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as an Assistant Surgeon and was stationed in India during the second Afghan war. The regiment had already advanced into enemy territory when he arrived, and he eventually reached Candahar where he began his duties. However, the campaign resulted in misfortune for him, including being removed from his brigade and serving at the battle of Maiwand, where he was wounded by a Jezail bullet.

After recovering partially, he was deemed unfit for duty due to his poor health and was sent back to England on the troopship Orontes.\nHere is a summary of the previous context:\n\nThe narrator graduated with a Doctor of Medicine degree from the University of London in 1878.
